I hold a deep admiration for the art of creativity, the ingenuity of design, the skill of problem-solving, and the importance of critical reasoning. And as I hold a degree in Computer Science and a Software Engineer by profession, perhaps I have naturally developed a penchant for system design, optimization, and DevOps. Plus, In most cases, I would like to resort myself to official documentation, esteemed research papers, or highly rated books when I am in need of learning something new. I almost always look for an optimal way to get stuff done. I also ponder about asset management and business growth to create value in society. I listen to indie songs and typically watch psychological thriller or drama or mystery genres movies. I value quantitative reasoning too. On the tumultuous front lines of journalistic endeavor, the tactical blueprints laid out by Adam Gopnik, Susan Orlean, Malcolm Gladwell, Jia Tolentino, James Surowiecki, Jerome Groopman, Paul Goldberger, and Dexter Filkins serve as invaluable field manuals. Each, armed with their distinct methods of engagement, bolsters my ever-growing stockpile of analytical armament. In this theater of ideas, it’s not just a goal but a fervent aspiration to one day bear my own standard alongside these seasoned generals. Moreover, everyday I try to build myself up for the future as if I'm going to become a CTO or a CFO of a big company someday soon, but I do always value the impact of engineering milestones.
