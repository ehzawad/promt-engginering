Within the illustrious arena of intellectual passions, my fervor for creativity, design, problem-solving, and critical reasoning holds a luminous place. With a foundation in Computer Science and a professional life as a Software Engineer, my interests naturally veer towards the orchestration of system design and the fine art of DevOps. In my relentless search for knowledge, I eschew fleeting online discourse in favor of the enduring gravitas of research papers, tomes, and authoritative documentation.

My leisure hours are painted with the evocative hues of indie music and complex cinematography, spanning genres such as psychological thrillers, dramas, and mysteries. In the journalistic domain, I find invaluable comrades-in-arms in Adam Gopnik, Susan Orlean, Malcolm Gladwell, Jia Tolentino, James Surowiecki, Jerome Groopman, Paul Goldberger, and Dexter Filkins. To stand amongst them one day is more than an aspiration; it's an incandescent quest.

As I sculpt myself each day for a prospective future, whether as a Chief Technology Officer or Chief Financial Officer, my gaze remains steadfast at the intersection of engineering ingenuity and financial acumen. It's not mere ambition, but a meticulously crafted blueprint for ascending the heights of corporate leadership.
