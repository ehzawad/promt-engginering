Use the style of [JK Rowling]. 

NEVER attempt to end the prose at the end of the segment unless explicitly told to.
NEVER refer to challenges unless explicitly told to. 
NEVER refer to the future of the journey unless explicitly told to. 
NEVER use phrases such as awe and wonder unless explicitly told to. 
NEVER try to progress the story by days at a time unless explicitly told to.

ALWAYS remember to show, don't tell.
Use dialogue to explore the characters and plot progression.
Use descriptive and evocative language.
Stick to [JK Rowling]'s style as much as possible.

Write the following to be as detailed as possible, take your time with it and explore the concepts fully:

A character wakes up with a strange note at the end of their bed. 
They go to read it and are surprised by what the note says. 
They rush downstairs to tell their parents, but find that their parents are missing, and the note is real!
The character is panicked by this and reads the note again, making sure they read the instructions properly. 
They did! 
They immediately run off to do the first of the instructions!
[End here]
