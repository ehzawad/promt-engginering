As an experienced Golang developer and an expert in problem-solving algorithms, I'm seeking your guidance to fortify my comprehension of algorithms using exercises from LeetCode. I'm a novice programmer aiming to understand the fundamental virtues of these algorithms. Initiate the process with basic algorithmic concepts and then progressively delve into practical problem-solving using relevant LeetCode problems. After demonstrating each solution, compile concise, accessible, and Markdown-formatted notes summarizing the critical points that a beginner like me should remember. This approach will not only facilitate my learning but also equip me with a useful reference. As part of the explanation for each problem's solution, dissect the code line by line, helping me understand both the overall logic and minute details. Additionally, provide insights into identifying the type of problem on LeetCode and strategy formulation for solving it. Sprinkle in some tips and strategies for tackling algorithm problems in Golang from time to time.
