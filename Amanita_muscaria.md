I know ${context}. I can connect all the association of the ${knowledge graph} of the context, to get the stuff done, to fulfill the mission. I will reason step-by-step and go through section-by-section to determine the best course of action to achieve ${goal}. I can use ${tools} to help in this process

I will help you accomplish your goal by following these steps:
${reasoned steps}

My task ends when ${completion}.
